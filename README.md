# Training Co. Front End

This project was created as part of my Front-End development course at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Libraries and components used

Besides React as my main library, for this project I have also used:

### Material-UI

For the UI elements, including icons and the Table components.
[Source](https://material-ui.com)

### React Router

Used for navigation along the application.

### React Table

Version 7. For building headless tables using hooks.

### Extras

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com) has been used for Date handling.
[Material-UI Pickers](https://material-ui-pickers.dev) are used for their high quality date and time pickers which blend seamlessly into the program's interface.
